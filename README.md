# 04-Coding-Quiz


## Description

This project we were tasked with creating a timed quiz. It will randomly select a question from the array and if the user selects the correct answer there will be a confirmation and if incorrect they will be told it was incorrect.

This challenge we had to create everything from the ground up, I started by creating the HTML file and used the previous challenge as a guide for my HTML. Then I started getting some styling for the page and then spent most of the time getting the JavaScript set up. 
I created an array full of all the questions and answers to those questions.

Then variables for every element, then started creating all the functions. I also added sound for when the user gets the correct answer right/wrong.

This challenge was definitely stretching to get more used to javascript and how to use it.
